# Technical Drawing for Electronics School (Manual Drawing with Sheet and Technical Folder)  

## 📋 Overview  
This repository contains resources, assignments, and guidelines related to **Manual Technical Drawing** for students in an electronics school. The focus is on developing hand-drawing skills using paper, technical drawing tools, and a drawing folder. Accurate technical drawings are essential for understanding and communicating electronic designs, particularly in circuit representation.  

---

## 🛠️ Topics Covered  
- **Drawing Instruments**: Proper use of rulers, compasses, set squares, and protractors.  
- **Sheet Organization**: Guidelines for properly formatting technical drawing sheets, including margins, title blocks, and scale.  
- **Electronic Component Symbols**: Manual representation of resistors, capacitors, transistors, and other components.  
- **Circuit Diagrams**: Drawing simple and complex circuit diagrams by hand, adhering to standard conventions.  
- **PCB Layout Sketches**: Hand-drawn sketches of printed circuit boards (PCBs).  
- **Lettering and Annotations**: Proper lettering techniques for labeling drawings.  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
Before beginning with the assignments, ensure you have the following materials:  
- **Technical Drawing Tools**: Compass, ruler, protractor, set squares, technical pens, and pencils (HB, 2H, etc.).  
- **Drawing Sheets**: Standard size sheets (A4, A3) for technical drawing.  
- **Technical Folder**: A folder to organize and submit your drawings.  
- **Electronics Knowledge**: Basic understanding of electronic components and circuits.  

---

## 📚 Resources  
- [Technical Drawing Standards](#) - A guide to symbols and formatting standards for manual technical drawing.  
- [Basic Electronics for Drafting](#) - A refresher on the key components you'll be drawing.  

---

## 💡 Assignments  
1. **Assignment 1**: Draw a simple circuit schematic by hand, including a resistor, LED, and power source, on an A4 sheet.  
2. **Assignment 2**: Create a hand-drawn layout for a basic power supply circuit on A3 paper, including all necessary components.  
3. **Assignment 3**: Sketch a PCB layout for a small amplifier circuit using proper scale and formatting.  

---

## 📝 Guidelines for Sheet Formatting  
- **Margins**: Maintain 1cm margins on all sides.  
- **Title Block**: Include your name, course, date, and assignment title in the title block.  
- **Scale**: Indicate the scale used for each drawing clearly.  
- **Lettering**: Use block letters for annotations, ensuring they are neat and legible.  

---

## 📂 Folder Organization  
- Use a **Technical Drawing Folder** to organize all your sheets.  
- Ensure each sheet is labeled and ordered by assignment.  
- Keep your folder clean and free of wrinkles or smudges for submission.
